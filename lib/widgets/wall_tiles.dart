//Import the Material package

//Create a StatelessWidget called WallTiles()

//Inside of it's build() method return a Scaffold() without an AppBar()
//The Scaffold's body gets a Column()
//The Column() will receive a generated number of Row() and Column() widgets
//These Row() and Column() widgets will receive a generated number of Container() widgets
//These Container() widgets will be the lines when put in perspective by the Transform() widget
//Will finally form a Wall Tile
